#i3 + GNOME = <3

This is a quick little script to enable you to use the
[i3](http://i3wm.org/) tiling window manager with a normal Gnome
3 desktop. I use it on Debian, it should work anywhere Gnome does though.

The files used are from [here](https://github.com/lvillani/i3-gnome).

##Usage

Just clone the repo and do `sudo ./setup.sh`.
